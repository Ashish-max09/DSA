Imagine you have n friends sitting in a circle, numbered 1 to n.

You are given a number k.
k tells you how many friends to count before someone gets eliminated.

How it works:
Start at Friend 1.

Count k friends, moving clockwise (like going around a clock).

Include the friend you start at as the first count.

The k-th friend you land on is eliminated (they leave the circle).

Start counting again from the friend right after the one who got eliminated.

Repeat steps 2â€“4 until only one friend is left.

That last friend is the winner!

Solution:
import java.util.*;

public class WinnerOfGame {
    public static int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        List<Integer> friends = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            friends.add(i);
        }
        
        int idx = 0;
        
        while (friends.size() > 1) {
            idx = (idx + k - 1) % friends.size();  // Find the k-th friend (circularly)
            friends.remove(idx);  // Eliminate that friend
        }
        
        return friends.get(0);  // The last remaining friend
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5, k = 2;
        System.out.println(findTheWinner(n, k));  // Output: 3

        n = 6;
        k = 5;
        System.out.println(findTheWinner(n, k));  // Output: 1
    }
}
